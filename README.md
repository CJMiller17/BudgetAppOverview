# BudgetAppOverview
This is the project overview of the budgeting app for Code:You


Project Overview:

I want to create a simple budgeting app that will help people visualize their income and
their expenses. I worked at a bank for a number of years and discovered if people were more
aware of their spending, they are more apt to make positive changes. I want to break down
expenses by categories, so they can see what their most used category is and how they make
adjustments. I also want them to have a line graph where they can see daily expenses and how
that relates to their income.

Technical Insight:

I will be using C# (of course) and will most likely have to use component libraries that will
do the “heavy lifting” with the visual aspects of the graphs. I will create my own API. I will most
likely have dummy profiles instead of real profiles of users. This avoids having to implement
Auth (passwords and context). These profiles will be able to add their own transactions and it be
displayed showing only their info. However, any profile will be able to add a category and it be
available to everyone.
